## shoppingCard
This project is a furniture e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When the page loads, product data from a mock API is displayed on the page. Each product is displayed on a card with an image, title, price and an add to cart button. The product is added to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button below each product card. If a product has already been added, the button is disabled and made transparent. The contents of the cart are displayed by clicking on the cart icon. Each product is displayed with a picture, title, price, price, quantity edit buttons and a remove button. The relevant buttons can be used to increase, decrease or delete the quantity of each product. All products can be removed from the cart with the clear cart button. For each transaction in the cart, the total amount and the total number of products are updated. This information is automatically updated every time a product is added or removed or its quantity in the cart is updated. Product data and cart information is stored in the browser using Local Storage. When the page is refreshed or closed, the products and cart information added by the user are retained.

## animatedProgressSteps
This project was made to control and update the animated progress bar that moves step by step. When the Next button is clicked, the currentActive value is incremented and then the progress bar and circles are updated. If on the last step (currentActive at maximum), the currentActive value is fixed to the last step. Clicking Prev decreases the currentActive value and then updates the progress bar and circles. If in the first step (currentActive at minimum), the currentActive value is fixed to 1.

## animatedMenu
It represents a web page with an animated menu, a navigation bar with Font Awesome icons and a main content area with text, images and a header. It manages a simple JavaScript interaction to open and close an animated menu on the page. The "open" and "close" button click events control the visibility of the animated menu by adding or removing the "show-nav" class. This way, when users click on the "open" button the menu becomes visible and when they click on the "close" button the menu is hidden.
